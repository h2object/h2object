h2object
=============
another fast & flexible static website generator & deployment tool

## What's h2object?

At First h2object project just as name , provider the object service over http api.
Now the project evolved to be a static website generator base on markdown grammar files.
And considing of the deployment inconvenience, refer to the docker's push & pull mechanism,
h2object provides deploy functions.As result, the h2object project now is very fast static
website generator and website deploy tool, with only few commands to finishing a website from
creating to deployment.

## Design principles

*	one command to install and one command to deploy
*	more flexible for website generate, no only list page & detail pages 
*	all pages generated by markdown files are indexed and can query directly, not need third plugins
*	custom theme can be published and shared for any one like it, still few commands to do the flow
